## Script objective
[Lotto](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto) is a very popular polish lottery organized by [Totalizator Sportowy](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalizator_Sportowy) since 1957. Although there are many games, the most known and the most popular - with the highest stakes - is game calles [Lotto](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_(gra_liczbowa)) and this script focuses on retrieving exactly those results.

## How it works
Script connects to the lotto API and downloads the results of the main game.
Results are presented in a form of a string e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

## Future development
Goals for now:
- [] schedule script to run on certain dates
- [] trigger script on demand via sms
- [] allow script to send sms with results
